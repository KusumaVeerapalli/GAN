# GAN

Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN) Project Documentation

Step 1: Dataset Preparation
Step 2: Build and Train the SRGAN
Step 3: Show Examples of Scaled Images in Jupyter Notebook (JNB)
Step 4: Utilize Images Generated by SRGAN to Train a New Model (Model B)
Step 5: Divide the Dataset into Training and Testing Sets
Step 6: Apply Normalization and Image Transformation
Step 7: Compare Model Performance
Step 8: Save Models After Each N Epoch

All the steps are explained in detail in the SRGAN DOCUMENT.pdf
